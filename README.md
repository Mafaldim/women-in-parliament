# Women Representation in Parliaments

## Historical Background

In many countries, women have been under-represented in the government and different institutions. *Figure 1* shows the percentage of women participation in parliaments averaged for all countries around the world from 1945 to 2018. It's apparent that this historical tendency still persists, although women's percentage in national parliaments is constandly increasing showing an impressive rise through the last 20 years; from 10% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2018.

The rise is more obvious looking at the global average of women participation in national parliaments by decade as shown in *Figure 2* and *Figure 3*. In the 50's and 60's, women accounted only for 5% of parliament members whilst in the late 70's their percentage almost doubled reaching 9% of total. 80's and 90's followed the same upward trend with 1.4% and 1.7% increase in the global average from the previous decade respectively. However, the highest percentage increase through the years was from 90's to 00's (almost 5.5%); the mean global percentage of women participation reached 16% in the 00's compared to 10.4% in the 90's. Women's participation continued to rise with the rate from 2000 onwards, reaching almost 25% in the recent years.
