## Women Representation in National Parliaments

In many countries, women have been under-represented in the government and different institutions. In the present demonstration, we are exploring gender balance in national parliaments since 1945 through interactive plots based on historical data on the proportion of seats held by women worldwide from Inter-Parliamentary Union ([IPU Parline - Global data on national parliaments](https://data.ipu.org/historical-women) )
 using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) Python's graphing library.
