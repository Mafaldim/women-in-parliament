    <h1 >While more women than ever are being elected to parliaments around the world, 
        gender parity is still a long way off, and progress is painfully slow. 
        Most parliaments are still heavily male-dominated, and some have no women MPs at all.
        In the present demonstration, we explore gender balance using historical data on the 
        proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments worldwide from IPU.

            <p>In many countries, women have been under-represented in the government and different institutions. 
                The figure below shows the yearly percentage of women's participation in parliaments averaged for all countries around the world from 1945 to 2018. It is apparent that there is a historical tendency of insufficient representation, although women's percentage in national parliaments is constantly increasing; 
                there was an impressive rise through the last 20 years from 10% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2018.</p>

            <p>The rise is more obvious looking at the global average of women's participation in national parliaments by 
                decade as shown in the following figure. In the '50s and '60s, women accounted only for 5% of 
                parliament members whilst in the late '70s, their percentage almost doubled to 9% of the total. 
                '80s and '90s followed the same upward trend with 23% and 31% increase in the global average from 
                the previous decade respectively. However, the highest percentage increase through the years was 
                from '90s to '00s (almost 52%); the mean global percentage of women participation reached 16% 
                in the '00s compared to 10.5% in the '90s. Women's participation continued to rise to the same 
                rate from 2000 onwards, reaching almost 25% in recent years. </p>
