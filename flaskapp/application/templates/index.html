    <h1 >While more women than ever are being elected to parliaments around the world, 
        gender parity is still a long way off and progress is painfully slow. 
        Most parliaments are still heavily male-dominated, and some have no women MPs at all.

        In this demonstration, you can explore gender balance in national parliaments since 1945 through interactive
        plots  based on historical data on the 
        proportion of seats held by women worldwide from <a href="https://www.ipu.org/">Inter-Parliamentary Union</a>.

                    The figure on the left shows the yearly percentage of women's participation in parliaments averaged 
                    for all countries around the world from 1945 to 2018. 
                    It is apparent that there is a historical tendency of insufficient representation,
                    however women's representation increased overtime. Since 1995, there is an upwa

                    starting with only a very small proportion 
                    although the proportion of women parliamentarians is constantly increasing.
                    increased overtime

                    Before 1995
                    in the later years upward trend
                     

                    there was an impressive rise through the last 20 years from 10% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2018.</p>

            <p> In many countries, women have been under-represented in the government 
                and different institutions. 
                The rise is more obvious looking at the global average of women's participation in national parliaments by 
                decade as shown in the following figure. In the '50s and '60s, women accounted only for 5% of 
                parliament members whilst in the late '70s, their percentage almost doubled to 9% of the total. 
                '80s and '90s followed the same upward trend with 23% and 31% increase in the global average from 
                the previous decade respectively. However, the highest percentage increase through the years was 
                from '90s to '00s (52%); the median global percentage of women participation reached 16% 
                in the '00s compared to 10.5% in the '90s. Women's participation continued to rise to the same 
                rate from 2000 onwards, reaching almost 25% in recent years. </p>

        <p>In five countries; Rwanda, Cuba, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates, women now account for 50 per cent or 
            more MPs in their lower or single chambers.

            Rwanda..
            
            In Europe, it's mostly the Nordic countries that have women holding over 40 per cent of parliamentary seats.
        
            Women’s parliamentary representation in the Pacific is the lowest compared to other parts of the world. 
            Despite Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji the region still counts many countries with less than 10% in representation and
            the only three parliaments in the world with no women members (Federated States of Micronesia, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu).
