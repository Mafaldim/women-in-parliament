### Structure of Parliament: 
- Bicameral

Bicameralism is the practice of having a legislature divided into two separate assemblies, chambers, or houses, known as a bicameral legislature. Bicameralism is distinguished from unicameralism, in which all members deliberate and vote as a single group.

- A **lower house** is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house. Despite its official position "below" the upper house, in many legislatures worldwide, the lower house has come to wield more power or otherwise exert significant political influence.

- Unicameral

Unicameralism is the practice of having a single legislative or parliamentary chamber. Thus, a unicameral parliament or unicameral legislature is a legislature which consists of a single chamber or house.

As of 2015, about 40% of world's national legislatures are bicameral, and about 60% are unicameral

- Constituent Assembly

The original dataset included information in women participation by country level from 1945-2018. In order to get an overview about the subject, the yearly average percentage of women participation has been calculated

In the present notebook, a historical dataset on the percentage of women in parliament between 1945-2018 derived from [Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Parline](https://data.ipu.org/historical-women) is being explored through interactive graphs using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) Python library.
